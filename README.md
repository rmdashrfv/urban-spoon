## Git Diff
View the difference between the remote (what's on Github)
and local (what's on your computer)

By default `git diff` will check the entire repo.
You can add files as arguments to git diff like so;

`git diff main.js`

**You have to press 'q' to get out of this prompt.**

## Git Log
Shows all of the previous commits. You must also press "q" to get out of
this. Vim is most likely the best editor there is.
